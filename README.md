# 🧠 NLP Tokenization from Scratch

This repository documents my exploration of how tokenization works under the hood — from simple whitespace splitting to Byte Pair Encoding (BPE), WordPiece, and SentencePiece.  
It’s part of my personal learning portfolio on NLP fundamentals and LLM pre-processing.

## 🚀 Goals

- Build and visualize tokenization algorithms from scratch.
- Understand how subword tokenization compresses vocabulary.
- Compare custom tokenizers with Hugging Face implementations.
